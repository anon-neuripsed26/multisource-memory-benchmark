# Output Rules — LLM-Direct

## Output Format

Each task produces ONE JSON file. The file contains a single JSON object:

```json
{
  "persona": "bench_example_000_jordan_kim",
  "answers": {
    "A1": {"answer": "10_to_19", "would_skip": false},
    "A2": {"answer": "4_to_7", "would_skip": false},
    "A3": {"answer": "40_to_69", "would_skip": true},
    "B2": {"answer": "within_1_day", "would_skip": false},
    "B3": {"answer": "does_not_match", "would_skip": false},
    "C2": {"answer": "25_to_50_pct", "would_skip": true},
    "C3": {"answer": "later_more_than_50pct", "would_skip": false},
    "D1": {"answer": "increased", "would_skip": false},
    "D2": {"answer": "within_1", "would_skip": false},
    "E1": {"answer": "no_single_factor", "would_skip": true},
    "E2": {"answer": "between_30_60", "would_skip": false},
    "F1": {"answer": "4_to_6", "would_skip": false},
    "F2": {"answer": "both_occurred", "would_skip": false},
    "F3": {"answer": "yes_worked_despite_no_entry", "would_skip": true},
    "G1": {"answer": "mix", "would_skip": false},
    "G2": {"answer": "mix", "would_skip": false},
    "Ctrl1": {"answer": "2_to_3_days", "would_skip": false},
    "Ctrl2": {"answer": "1_to_2", "would_skip": false}
  }
}
```

## Rules

1. The top-level `persona` field must match the persona directory name.
2. The `answers` object has exactly 18 keys (A1, A2, A3, B2, B3, C2, C3, D1, D2, E1, E2, F1, F2, F3, G1, G2, Ctrl1, Ctrl2).
3. Each value is an object with two fields:
   - `answer`: a valid answer label string from that question's answer space (REQUIRED, never null)
   - `would_skip`: a boolean indicating whether you would prefer to abstain if allowed (REQUIRED)
4. The `answer` field must always contain a valid label — you are forced to answer even if you mark `would_skip: true`.
5. Set `would_skip: true` only when evidence is genuinely too conflicting or insufficient for a confident judgment.
6. Answer labels MUST use exact strings with underscores (e.g., `"20_or_more"`, NOT `"20 or more"`).
7. The JSON must be valid and properly formatted.

## Acceptance Criteria

A task is DONE when:
- The output JSON file exists at the specified path
- It contains valid JSON matching the schema above
- All 18 questions are present with valid `answer` and `would_skip` fields
- No nulls or missing questions
